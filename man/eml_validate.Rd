\description{
Programmatic interface to the online parsing tool https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/emlparser/parse
}
\details{
More detailed testing against the schema can be performed using the xmlSchemaValidate
  function from the XML package, which will report information on exactly what lines fail the 
  test, if any.  However, this performs only the first of the two checks provided by the online
  tool, which also checks that all referenced internal ids (describes nodes) correspond to matching ids.  

  This function requires an internet connection.
